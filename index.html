        <h4>Reading, such a wonderful thing to do...It cheers me up when I am upset, entertains me when I am bored. But
            `these days people don't read as much as they use too.<br>
            I don't think they know what they are missing. Reading is fun ,gets us good with grammer ,and gets past time
            faster than fast.<br>
            In my opinion everyone should read in their spare time rather than watching programs on telivision or
            tapping thier phone every second.<br>see right there that is the magic of reading.</h4>
